commerce-types
==============
Can we usefully characterize a commercial center by the composition of businesses?

For a four block segments of commercial zoned areas, we can get a count of the different types of businesses. 
This count could come from the [google places API](https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/supported_types#table2) 
or [Business Licenses](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Business-Licenses/r5kz-chrr), and 
other sources? 

If we had counts for a large sample of these four block segments, we could attempt to find a set of latent classes or factors
that we can use to characterize these areas.

This could be the first step of a project that looked at the ecological changes of commercial mix.

where U of C researchers characterized zipcodes based on commercial compilations of yellow page data.
